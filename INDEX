bootstrap.ktsp		Bootstrap procedure for the k-TSP
bootstrap.graphic.ktsp	Graphical display of the bootstrap procedure
ROC.offset		This function creates a ROC object used by the function ROC.graphic() to plot a ROC curve of the method based on adding an 				offset on each pair of gene.
ROC.voting		This function creates a ROC object used by the function ROC.graphic.ktsp() to plot a ROC curve of the method based on cutoff 				on the majority voting system.
ROC.graphic.ktsp	This functions displays the results of the ROC curve obtained through the function ROC()
